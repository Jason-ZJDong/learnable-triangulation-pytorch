# Testing on a General Dataset

Before we begin, make sure you have followed the steps [here](SETUP_GENERAL_DATASET.md) to setup your dataset.

This README aims to document the additional steps required to **test/evaluate** a general dataset. If you would like to evaluate it instead, see the document for [training a general dataset](TRAINING_ON_GENERAL_DATASET.md).
