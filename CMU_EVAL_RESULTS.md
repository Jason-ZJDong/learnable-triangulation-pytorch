# CMU Dataset Evaluation Results

I was able to successfully test the CMU dataset using the pretrained weights for Human3.6M, with the volumetric triangulation algorithm. There was some discussion on the various issues [here](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/issues/75) and [here](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/issues/76). I am currently working on training the CMU panoptic studio dataset.
